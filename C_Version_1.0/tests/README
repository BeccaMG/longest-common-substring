DESCRIPTION:
============

Tests for the Longest Common Substring project. The used tool was CUnit 
documented in http://cunit.sourceforge.net/

HOW TO RUN TESTS:
=================

Run these commands:

	$> make
    $> ./longest_common_substring_finder_tests && ./file_manager_tests

Each test file will create a different executable so it's necessary to run both
to have all tests at the same time. If needed, they can be run separately.
