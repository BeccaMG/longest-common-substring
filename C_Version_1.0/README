DESCRIPTION:
============

This program is an implementation of the algorithm to find the Longest Common 
Substring between two files given as input from stdin. Is intended to run in a
linux environment only. The program is tested with the tool CUnit.

HOW TO RUN:
===========

Run these commands:

    $> cd src/
	$> make
    $> ./longest_common_substring <file1> <file2>


LIMITS:
=======

* The maximum input files should have no more than 2000 characters between both.
This means is possible to have combinations like 2000 + 0, 1000+1000 or any
alike. Segmentation fault appears after this limit.

TESTS:
======

For more information about testing, see tests/README.
